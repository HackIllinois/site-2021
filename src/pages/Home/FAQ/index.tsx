        <h4>What kind of projects can I work on?</h4>
        <p>
          Because we aren’t limiting submissions to Open Source Contributions, there’s <b>no limit</b> to what you can work on! Any project submission of any level is allowed, no matter the goal or theme of the end product.
        </p>

        <h4>What if I don’t have that much programming experience?</h4>
        <p>
          People of all programming levels are welcome! You’ll have the chance to gain technical experience through workshops and work with mentors who can guide you with your project idea.
        </p>

        <h4>How do applications work?</h4>
        <p>
          There is no application! Just register <a href="/registration">here</a> and we will send you more information about our event - everyone is accepted! Registration is open until the end of the event. In order to join our Discord server and submit a project, you will need to register! You must be 18+ to register.
        </p>

        <h4>Where can I go for more information?</h4>
        <p>

        <h4>What do I need as a virtual hacker?</h4>
        <p>
          You won’t need much to get the most out of your HackIllinois experience. All it’ll take is:
          <ul>
            <li>A Github account to share and collaborate on your code with others.</li>
            <li>A Discord account to work and engage with teammates, mentors, and other attendees.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Can I work in a team? Alone?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes! HackIllinois allows teams of up to size 6. While teamwork is highly encouraged to ensure the most effective ideation and development over the span of the event, with a discord channel dedicated towards finding teammates, individual submissions are also allowed.
